What is java class file

The Java class file is a precisely defined format for compiled Java. Java source code is compiled into class files that can be loaded and executed by any JVM

What is jvm

Java virtual machine (JVM), an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine Specification, interprets compiled Java binary code (called bytecode) for a computer's processor (or "hardware platform") so that it can perform a Java program's instructions.

A Linux machine with ext2 filesystem if it crashed then at reboot, kernel would have to scan the entire filesystem for corrupt files. EXT3 has something called as journalingm what it does is this, When a kernel open a file for any operation it marks the file as open in the filesystem so at the time of system crash it just has to check the authencity of those particular files.

EXT4 has option of ecnrypting the filesystem at the time of installation.

Apache and tomcat integration using mod_jk


1) Install apache and make sure mod_rewrite and mod_proxy modules are available to apache

2) Download and Install the mod_jk connector
	untar the source code of tomcat-connectors-1.2.41-src.tar.gz
3) cd tomcat-connectors-1.2.41-src/native
	
4) start the mod_jk compilation process Incase apxs is not installed you need to install it .

* apxs is a tool for building and installing extension modules for the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. This is achieved by building a dynamic shared object (DSO) from one or more source or object files which then can be loaded into the Apache server under runtime via the LoadModule directive from mod_so.
  Install apache2-dev for debian based os and httpd-devel for rhel based os. Once apxs is successfully install, we can continue with mod_jk compilation.

	cd /tomcat-connectors-1.2.41-src/native

	./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs  		Incase if gcc is not install it will throw errors, make sure it is installed.
	sudo make
	sudo make install
	
	
5) Make sure the module has been installed by checking into /usr/lib64/httpd/modules, But you still need to mention about the module in apache conf file.
	LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so

6) Configuring JK Connector:-
	
	a)Create a worker.properties in /etc/httpd/conf/ with following content

		worker.list=tomcat,tomcat2
		worker.tomcat.type=ajp13
		worker.tomcat.host=192.168.122.30
		worker.tomcat.port=8009
	 
       	  	worker.tomcat2.type=ajp13
                worker.tomcat2.host=192.168.122.31
                worker.tomcat2.port=8009
	
	b)Make entry in httpd.conf
	
		JkWorkersFile 	"conf/worker.properties"
		JkLogfile	"logs/jk.log"
		
		JkMount /mytomcat*              tomcat2
		JkMount /sample*                tomcat

Now it should work fine webserver/mytomcat ------------> will open tomcat2
			webserver/sample   ------------> will open tomcat	

7) Incase if you want to go further with the configuration and create virtual hosts for the same.
	
	Create virtual host for the above config in apache
	
	NameVirtualHost *:80
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName mytomcat.technotronix.com
	JkMount /mytomcat*	tomcat2
	</VirtualHost>
	
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName sample.technotronix.com
	JkMount /sample*	tomcat2
	</VirtualHost>

Make sure that mytomcat.technotronix.com and sample.technotronix.com are pointing to your webserver in dns.

EVEN WITH THE ABOVE CONFIGURATION FOR VIRTUAL HOST, THINGS WON'T WORK AS WE NEED TO MAKE USE OF mod_rewrite module for url base regular expression catching.

8) Proper virtual host config

# Tomcat integration virtual host
 NameVirtualHost *:80
         
       <VirtualHost *:80>
                        ServerName mytomcat.technotronix.com
                        RewriteEngine on
                        RewriteLog logs/apache-mod_rewite
                        RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /mytomcat/$1 [l,PT]
                JkMount /*      tomcat2
        </VirtualHost>
         
        <VirtualHost *:80>
                         ServerName sample.technotronix.com
                         RewriteEngine on
                         RewriteLog logs/apache-mod_rewite
                         RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /sample/$1 [l,PT]
                 JkMount /*        tomcat
         </VirtualHost>

Tomcat load balance using mod_jk

1) We create worker.properties file with the following content

	worker.list=balancer,stat

	worker.tomcat.type=ajp13
	worker.tomcat.host=192.168.122.30
	worker.tomcat.port=8009
	worker.tomcat.lbfactor=10

	worker.tomcat2.type=ajp13
	worker.tomcat2.host=192.168.122.31
	worker.tomcat2.port=8009
	worker.tomcat2.lbfactor=10
	
	worker.balancer(canbeanyname).type=lb
	worker.balancer.balance_workers=tomcat,tomcat2
	worker.stat.type=status

Change in httpd.conf 		JkMount /* 	balancer
				JkMount /status stat

Tomcat based session affinity load balancing:-

Need to add jvmroute=workernamegiveninworker.properties under engine tag in server.xml in each worker's server.xml file according to the name given in worker.properties.

by default its like this <Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost">

According to my configuration what i will metion is below.

tomcat instance server.xml	<Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="tomcat">
tomcat2 instance server.xml	<Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="tomcat2">

* BUT with this moodle of loadbalancing another issue arrises if a user has been using a instance and all his work has been given to one of the tomcat instance incase of failure of that tomcat instance, the data specific to the user connected to that instance will get lost. In this the user will be given a new session which is from another tomcat instance.

LEARNING GIT	20-09-2015


git init 			---- to initialize git 

git status 			---- shows git status

git add filename 		---- will add it to the repository

git commit 			--- commiting the change

git commit -m "message"		-commit without going into the editor

git config --global user.name "bhaveshpatel"
git config --global user.email "bhaveshpatel826@gmail.com"
git config --global color.ui true

git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all --date-order
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
git config --global core.editor vim
git config --global --replace-all alias.l "log --graph --decorate --oneline -all --date-order"

git diff 		--- to check diff in between the stage that is once you do git add after change the file and agian you change it but you don't add itm it will show you the difference

git diff --staged

git diff HEAD

git diff --cached

git diff 1e13aa1 870d54b 	---Testing the diff between the commits

Branches are kind of pointer to the commit

git branch

git branch branchname

git checkout branchname		to checkout a branch and you switch to the given branch name

git stash

git checkout master
git merge feature	we merged feature into master, but you need to switch to master branch its like joing feature to master, so you need to be in master first and then merge feature to it.

git push -u origin master

git branch test			--would create a test branch
 
Incase you want to ingnore some files from the git directory that you need to create the .gitignore file inside that dir.

https://github.com/github/gitignore

Files in the staging area cannot be deleted unless you do a force remove.
			touch deleteme.txt
			git add deleteme.txt
			git rm deleteme.txt
			Its not gonna allow you to delet the deleteme.txt file
			error:'deleteme.txt' has changes staged in the index
	Then you have to forcefully delete it i.e	git rm -f deleteme.txt

git log
git log --pretty=oneline

git log --pretty=format:"%h : %an : %ar : %s"
			%h 	shows the hash
			%an	show who created the file
			%ar	date it was changed
			%s	show the first line of the file

git log -p -2			show the log for last 2 commit
git log --stat			shows abbreviated log
git log --since=1.weeks		shows log since last week
git log --since="2015-09-21"	shows log since the mentioned date
git log --befor="any date"	shows log before the mentioned date

git commit --amend		allows you to change the previously made commit

Incase if you decide to stage a file and you do the command git add filename and later you realise that you dont want to stage it you issue this command to over come this:-	git reset HEAD filename

git commit -m "commit message format"
Best parctice to follow the below mentioned format
	1)exactly the problem which also acts as a heading
	2)In a paragraph format describe the original problem that was addressed.
	3)Then go on to describe the result of the change.
	4)Any future improvements
