What is java class file

The Java class file is a precisely defined format for compiled Java. Java source code is compiled into class files that can be loaded and executed by any JVM

What is jvm

Java virtual machine (JVM), an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine Specification, interprets compiled Java binary code (called bytecode) for a computer's processor (or "hardware platform") so that it can perform a Java program's instructions.

A Linux machine with ext2 filesystem if it crashed then at reboot, kernel would have to scan the entire filesystem for corrupt files. EXT3 has something called as journalingm what it does is this, When a kernel open a file for any operation it marks the file as open in the filesystem so at the time of system crash it just has to check the authencity of those particular files.

EXT4 has option of ecnrypting the filesystem at the time of installation.

Apache and tomcat integration using mod_jk


1) Install apache and make sure mod_rewrite and mod_proxy modules are available to apache

2) Download and Install the mod_jk connector
	untar the source code of tomcat-connectors-1.2.41-src.tar.gz
3) cd tomcat-connectors-1.2.41-src/native
	
4) start the mod_jk compilation process Incase apxs is not installed you need to install it .

* apxs is a tool for building and installing extension modules for the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. This is achieved by building a dynamic shared object (DSO) from one or more source or object files which then can be loaded into the Apache server under runtime via the LoadModule directive from mod_so.
  Install apache2-dev for debian based os and httpd-devel for rhel based os. Once apxs is successfully install, we can continue with mod_jk compilation.

	cd /tomcat-connectors-1.2.41-src/native

	./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs  		Incase if gcc is not install it will throw errors, make sure it is installed.
	sudo make
	sudo make install
	
	
5) Make sure the module has been installed by checking into /usr/lib64/httpd/modules, But you still need to mention about the module in apache conf file.
	LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so

6) Configuring JK Connector:-
	
	a)Create a worker.properties in /etc/httpd/conf/ with following content

		worker.list=tomcat,tomcat2
		worker.tomcat.type=ajp13
		worker.tomcat.host=192.168.122.30
		worker.tomcat.port=8009
	 
       	  	worker.tomcat2.type=ajp13
                worker.tomcat2.host=192.168.122.31
                worker.tomcat2.port=8009
	
	b)Make entry in httpd.conf
	
		JkWorkersFile 	"conf/worker.properties"
		JkLogfile	"logs/jk.log"
		
		JkMount /mytomcat*              tomcat2
		JkMount /sample*                tomcat

Now it should work fine webserver/mytomcat ------------> will open tomcat2
			webserver/sample   ------------> will open tomcat	

7) Incase if you want to go further with the configuration and create virtual hosts for the same.
	
	Create virtual host for the above config in apache
	
	NameVirtualHost *:80
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName mytomcat.technotronix.com
	JkMount /mytomcat*	tomcat2
	</VirtualHost>
	
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName sample.technotronix.com
	JkMount /sample*	tomcat2
	</VirtualHost>

Make sure that mytomcat.technotronix.com and sample.technotronix.com are pointing to your webserver in dns.

EVEN WITH THE ABOVE CONFIGURATION FOR VIRTUAL HOST, THINGS WON'T WORK AS WE NEED TO MAKE USE OF mod_rewrite module for url base regular expression catching.

8) Proper virtual host config

# Tomcat integration virtual host
 NameVirtualHost *:80
         
       <VirtualHost *:80>
                        ServerName mytomcat.technotronix.com
                        RewriteEngine on
                        RewriteLog logs/apache-mod_rewite
                        RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /mytomcat/$1 [l,PT]
                JkMount /*      tomcat2
        </VirtualHost>
         
        <VirtualHost *:80>
                         ServerName sample.technotronix.com
                         RewriteEngine on
                         RewriteLog logs/apache-mod_rewite
                         RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /sample/$1 [l,PT]
                 JkMount /*        tomcat
         </VirtualHost>

Tomcat load balance using mod_jk

1) We create worker.properties file with the following content

	worker.list=balancer,stat

	worker.tomcat.type=ajp13
	worker.tomcat.host=192.168.122.30
	worker.tomcat.port=8009

	worker.tomcat2.type=ajp13
	worker.tomcat2.host=192.168.122.31

	worker.tomcat2.lbfactor=10
	
	worker.balancer(canbeanyname).type=lb
	worker.balancer.balance_workers=tomcat,tomcat2
	worker.stat.type=status

Change in httpd.conf 		JkMount /* 	balancer

LEARNING GIT	20-09-2015


git init 			---- to initialize git 

git status 			---- shows git status

git add filename 		---- will add it to the repository

git commit 			--- commiting the change

git commit -m "message"		-commit without going into the editor

git config --global user.name "bhaveshpatel"
git config --global user.email "bhaveshpatel826@gmail.com"
git config --global color.ui true

git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all --date-order
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
git config --global core.editor vim
git config --global --replace-all alias.l "log --graph --decorate --oneline -all --date-order"

git diff 		--- to check diff in between the stage that is once you do git add after change the file and agian you change it but you don't add itm it will show you the difference

git diff --staged

git diff HEAD

git diff --cached

git diff 1e13aa1 870d54b 	---Testing the diff between the commits

Branches are kind of pointer to the commit

git branch

git branch branchname

git checkout branchname		to checkout a branch and you switch to the given branch name

git stash

git checkout master
git merge feature	we merged feature into master, but you need to switch to master branch its like joing feature to master, so you need to be in master first and then merge feature to it.

git push -u origin master

git branch test			--would create a test branch
 
Incase you want to ingnore some files from the git directory that you need to create the .gitignore file inside that dir.

https://github.com/github/gitignore

Files in the staging area cannot be deleted unless you do a force remove.
			touch deleteme.txt
			git add deleteme.txt
			git rm deleteme.txt
			Its not gonna allow you to delet the deleteme.txt file
			error:'deleteme.txt' has changes staged in the index
	Then you have to forcefully delete it i.e	git rm -f deleteme.txt

git log
git log --pretty=oneline

git log --pretty=format:"%h : %an : %ar : %s"
			%h 	shows the hash
			%an	show who created the file
			%ar	date it was changed
			%s	show the first line of the file

git log -p -2			show the log for last 2 commit
git log --stat			shows abbreviated log
git log --since=1.weeks		shows log since last week
git log --since="2015-09-21"	shows log since the mentioned date
git log --befor="any date"	shows log before the mentioned date

git commit --amend		allows you to change the previously made commit

Incase if you decide to stage a file and you do the command git add filename and later you realise that you dont want to stage it you issue this command to over come this:-	git reset HEAD filename

git commit -m "commit message format"
Best parctice to follow the below mentioned format
	1)exactly the problem which also acts as a heading
	2)In a paragraph format describe the original problem that was addressed.
	3)Then go on to describe the result of the change.
	4)Any future improvements


git remote -v 			--show remote repos name
git pull remoterepoaddress	

git remote rename origin sf		--- this will rename the git remote directory from origin to sf

Creating a tag for my previous commit, commit that i just made.
git tag -a 0.2 -m "Version 0.2"

 Now say that we have a previous commit how are we going to add a tag to those commits
	1)List out all of your commits on to the screen 		git log --pretty=oneline
	2)Copy the hash (just few charcters) foreg:-
		
	Below are my commits,

	bhavesh@workstation:~/mydocs$ git log --pretty=oneline
	46c9c20323e163f44a07cc629bdb47b59ab718e3 dailycommit
	983455e4fcfd3a857201d2a0c250cf427bb4301f aftersomeadded git command
	7674f67b2819538e46a5038490c69e7d040c140d antohertestcommitonbitbucket
	eecae0df034ef58ff0547d669b03d3c411d9095f mypersonaldoc
	
	3) Now we want to tag  7674f67b2819538e46a5038490c69e7d040c140d antohertestcommitonbitbucket
	4) git tag -a v0.5 7674f67b28

You can also push the tags to the remote repo

git push reponame v0.5
git push reponame --tags		That will add all the tags to the repo

Creating aliases for Git commands.

git config --global alias.co commit		---This creates alias "co" for "commit"

How to clone a git repository

git clone remoterepoaddress
for eg:-
git clone https://github.com/bhaveshpatel826/Python.git

Branching In git means taking the project in your own direction without affecting the the master code. So that you can go an work with the code without potentially introducing unstable code to the master branch.

###################################################### Learning Iptables 23-09-2015 ################################################################

Iptables is an front end to manage Netfilter which is integrated with kernel
Iptables function primarily at  osi layer 3(Network) and 4(Transport)
Iptables can manage icmp protocol which tends to operate at 3 and 4 layer of osi
Iptables comes along with various modules which increase itse functionality, and which can be loaded dynamically on the fly.

There are 3 default tables which cannot be deleted
	a) mangle -- alter packets withing tcp/icmp/udp/etc

	b) NAT	  -- to change source/dest to another souce/dest
 
	c) Filter -- Ip packet filtering (INPUT,FORWARD,OUTPUT)

iptables consist of tables within the table there are chains and with the chainsther are rules


*ACL SYTNAX

a)Make use of iptables command for constructing iptables based rules
	b)itpables  commands
	1)name of the chain - action what to do ( Append/Insert/Replace)
	2) name of the table --magle/nat/userdefined
	3)(filter),src/dest address)
	4)dest ports/src ports (optionally) -p --sport/--dport
	5)Jump/Target  -j ACCEPT/DROP/DENY/REJECT/LOG

for eg:- BLock source ip from communicating to our system
	iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.55.1 -j DROP
iptables  append to input chain source 192.168.55.1 jump target drop

* Saving and Restoring Rules via text files
a)iptables-save 	Dumps rules on the screen you need to redirect it.
b)iptables-restore	You can restore for a file

iptables -F  	Flush all the rules in all the chain in filter table.

c) To restore rules use iptables-restore < firewallrules.txt
d) To save rules use iptables-save > firewallrules.txt

Chain Mgmt In varios tables (Mangle/filter/nat/user-defined)

iptables -L 	will list the filter tables showing three chains
iptables -L -t nat this will list nat table
iptables -L -t mangle
iptables -L -v 		shows the number of packets have passed
iptables -L -v -n --line-numbers shows numbers for the rules

for eg:-
permit ssh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

deny telnet
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -dport 23 -j DROP

adding a rule on a particular line number so that it can be matched accordingly

iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport telnet -j DROP  this will insert the rule at 						   1 place in INPUT chain

Deleting and replacing rules

iptables -D INPUT 3	this will delete the rule on 3

iptables -R INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 23 -j ACCEPT	this will replace the 2 rule and 						replace from the given rule.
Flushing the rules:-

iptables -F		flushes rules for all the chains

iptables -Z INPUT	this will zero a given chain

Creating a user defined tables

packet processing in iptabels happens from top to down

iptables -N INTRANET		this will create a new chain as intranet

iptables -A INPUT 1 -s 192.168.122.0/24 -j INTRANET

any traffic belonging to 192.168.122.0 subnet it will be sent to intranet chain
we can carry on further processing from there on

user defined chains must have unique names

example rule in user made chain

iptables -A INTRANET -p tcp --dport 23 -j DROP

iptables -E INTRANET EXTRANET 	renames the userdefined chain

Defining default chain policy

iptables -P INPUT DROP 		default policy is set to drop

Iptables  Matching

-s;	-src ;	--source;	-->for matching any source
-d;	-dst ;	--destinition;	-->for matching any dest

iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -s 192.168.122.0/24 -j DROP

Thte above rule will block any traffic  from 192.168.122.0/24 coming from eth1 interface.
